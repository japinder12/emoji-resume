## Highlights
- Meaningful mapping: frameworks and tools beat base languages (‚öõÔ∏è over ‚ú®), Redis is üß± not a red square.
- Section-aware density: more room in Skills; concise lines in Experience/Projects.
- Balanced rows: reduces one-emoji lines by reflowing based on density.
- Accessible dark mode: toggle with a single key.
- Responsive: works on mobile.
- Quick actions: copy emojis, export PNG, and share a permalink (state in URL hash).
- Friendly parsing: handles single-line blobs and PDFs; splits on bullets, pipes, semicolons, and common section headers.

## How It Works
- Parser splits text into logical lines (bullets/pipes/section headers), then maps tech/keywords to emojis with strong/medium scoring and section caps.
- Frameworks demote base language emojis to keep output specific.
- Emojis are chunked into balanced rows by density before rendering.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- Copy emojis: ‚åò/Ctrl+Shift+C
- Export PNG: ‚åò/Ctrl+E
- Copy permalink: ‚åò/Ctrl+Shift+S
