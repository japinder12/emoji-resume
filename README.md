## Highlights
- Meaningful mapping: frameworks and tools beat base languages (‚öõÔ∏è over ‚ú®), Redis is üß± not a red square.
- Smart caps by section: Skills show more; Experience/Projects stay concise.
- Balanced rows: merges consecutive single‚Äëemoji lines, but keeps multi‚Äëemoji lines intact.
- Accessible dark mode: toggle with a single key.
- Responsive: works on mobile.
- Quick actions: copy emojis, export PNG, export SVG (vector), and share a permalink (state in URL hash).
- Friendly parsing: handles single-line blobs and PDFs; splits on bullets, pipes, semicolons, and common section headers.

### Exports
- PNG: raster export with a composed header bar for a consistent shareable frame.
- SVG: same box size/framing as PNG but in vector quality. Watermark appears only on export, not in the live preview.

## How It Works
- Parser splits text into logical lines (bullets/pipes/section headers), then maps tech/keywords to emojis with scoring and section-aware caps.
- A global repetition cap prevents spammy repeats across the whole card.
- Emojis are reflowed into balanced rows (4/6/8 per row), reducing fragmenting.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- Copy emojis: ‚åò/Ctrl+Shift+C
- Export PNG: ‚åò/Ctrl+E
- Copy permalink: ‚åò/Ctrl+Shift+S
